# 🛒 E-commerce Customer Segmentation Project
# Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers for an e-commerce platform using advanced clustering techniques. By identifying distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior, the project aims to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies more effectively. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

# 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on customer transactions from an e-commerce platform. It includes features such as customer IDs, purchase history, and product details.

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The first step involves preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is ready for clustering. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

Steps:

    📂 Load the Dataset: Explore the dataset to understand its structure.
    🧼 Clean the Data: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
    📏 Normalize the Data: Scale numerical features for consistency.
    🔠 Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into a format suitable for clustering algorithms.

# 🔍 Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

The core of the project involves segmenting customers using two different clustering techniques: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The best parameters are selected through cross-validation.

Steps:

    🎯 K-Means Clustering: Apply the K-Means algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
    
    🪜 Hierarchical Clustering: Use hierarchical clustering to identify natural groupings within the customer base.


# 🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully segments e-commerce customers into distinct groups using K-Means Clustering. The best parameters for K-Means Clustering were selected using cross-validation, ensuring optimal segmentation. The insights derived from these segments can be utilized for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and enhancing customer experiences.
